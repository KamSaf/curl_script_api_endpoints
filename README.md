# curl_script_api_endpoints

In this script the API, which is tested, is JSONBIN.io, which is an internet service, where you can upload, edit, delete and manage JSON files.

For testing I was using command-line tool curl.

I have chosen this API, because I believe it can be useful in some of my future projects.
